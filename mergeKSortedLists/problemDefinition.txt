#An 88% solution, I don't know why this one is marked as Hard on leetcode.  Could probably be made better with iterables.

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

Example:

Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
