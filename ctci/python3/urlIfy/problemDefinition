#Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.  May assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the 'true' length of the string.
#ex: Input -  "Mr John Smith    ", 13
#    Output - "Mr%20John%20Smith"
#See: There are enough spaces allocated to the end of Input so that we may later replace '%20' on each one.
