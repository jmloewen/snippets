#Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to compute the year with the most number of people alive.
#May assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000, inclusive.
#Ex:  person born in 1908 and dies in 1909, counts for both 1908 and 1909.

#Increment / Decrement, one pass, without sort.  O(Ranges + People)
