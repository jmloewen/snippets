#"Assume you have a method issubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another.
#given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubtring"
#Ex: "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat"

#Note: The wording on this problem is awful, or maybe the problem itself is just bad.
#It should either be asking me to check if something is a substring, give me the substring command outright, or be asking if both words are substrings of the other.
#The problem definition says "If S2 is a rotation of S1", but "gives" this substring command that
#isn't checking that S2 is a substring of S1, but if both are substrings of each other.
