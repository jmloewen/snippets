# Simulate a game of tic tac toe.

# * The board is three by three. There are two players. You may choose which of the two players starts the game.
# * To simulate a player turn, make a move on the board at random. In other words, every open square on the board should have an equal probability of being chosen for the playerâ€™s move at each turn.
# * Game ends when the board is full or a player has three of their marker in a row, column, or diagonal. 
# * When the game is over, your solution should print out the board.

#[0, 1, 2] [3,4,5], [6,7,8]
