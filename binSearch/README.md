A friend linked me this page on how Binary Search is usually done wrong:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/504335/what-are-the-pitfalls-in-implementing-binary-search

So i decided to spend some time doing Binary Search myself, to make sure that I'm able to do it correctly from memory, both iteratively and recursively.

Run and Tested on Leetcode Playground.
